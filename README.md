## Insurance Management System 
Under the guidance of Professor Dr. Ajay Gupta

Description

Traditionally, insurance companies issue insurance policies to the users based on a very limited amount of data, which reduces the scope of risk assessment. With the aid of telematic sensor data, machine learning algorithms to predict the claim status, the insurance agents will have a broader set of tools to actually visualize and their decision making is further enhanced by displaying the possible claim status prediction on the user dashboard using our Full-stack management system.

For data visualization purposes, telematic device parameters like extreme left and right turn, acceleration, braking activity, and days of weeks driven will be displayed in the dashboard specific to an Insurance customer. For computing the predicted value using the machine learning algorithm the feature engineering resulted in the selection of parameters like driving duration, age, car age, credit score, annual miles driven, no-claim-years, total miles driven, braking activity, acceleration, and time-driven during rush hours. To improve the accuracy of the machine learning model oversampling and under-sampling techniques like the SMOTE and SMOTE-TOMEK methods were employed.
